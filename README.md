# Dodge the Creeps

A simple game where the player must avoid enemies for as long as possible.

This is my first Godot project following the [Your first 2D game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html) tutorial.

This project is using Godot 4.1.1 .NET version.
